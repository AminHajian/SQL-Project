# Step three : Relational algebra 

### After creating the relational model (RM), you can perform operations on the model using relational algebra:

<br>

1. <b> Selection (σ):</b> Apply selection to retrieve specific rows from a table based on a given condition. For example, you can select all rows where a certain attribute meets a particular criteria.

2. <b>Projection (π):</b> Use projection to select specific columns from a table while discarding the others. This operation allows you to create a new relation with a subset of the attributes.

3. <b>Join (⨝):</b> Apply a join operation to combine two tables based on a common attribute. The join operation allows you to retrieve information from multiple tables by matching related values.

4. <b>Union (⋃):</b> Use the union operation to combine the rows from two tables into a single table. The tables involved in the union operation must have the same number of columns and compatible data types.

5. <b>Intersection (⋂):</b> Perform an intersection operation to retrieve the common rows between two tables. The tables involved in the intersection operation must have the same number of columns and compatible data types.
