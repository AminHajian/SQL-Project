# Step one : Design Database

### designing a database using the Entity-Relationship (ER) model: 
<br>

1. <b>Identify the entities:</b> Start by identifying the main entities involved in your system. These entities represent real-world objects or concepts that you want to store information about in your database.

2. <b>Define attributes:</b> For each entity, define the attributes or properties that describe it. Attributes represent the specific pieces of information you want to store for each entity.

3. <b>Identify relationships:</b> Determine the relationships between entities. Relationships define how the entities are related or connected to each other.

4. <b>Determine cardinality:</b> Determine the cardinality or multiplicity of each relationship. Cardinality specifies the number of occurrences of one entity that are associated with a single occurrence of the other entity.

5. <b>Resolve many-to-many relationships:</b> If you have any many-to-many relationships, you need to resolve them by introducing an intermediary entity or a junction table.

6. <b>Normalize the design:</b> Apply normalization techniques to ensure data integrity and eliminate redundancy. Normalization involves organizing the attributes into appropriate tables and removing any data duplication.

7. <b>Define primary keys:</b> Identify the primary key for each entity. A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table.

8. <b>Establish foreign keys:</b> Identify foreign keys to establish relationships between tables. Foreign keys are attributes in one table that refer to the primary key of another table.
