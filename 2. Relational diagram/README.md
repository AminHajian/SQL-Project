# Step two : Design RM

### After drawing the ER diagram, the next step is to convert it into a relational model (RM) by following these steps:

<br>

1. <b> Identify entities:</b> Review the entities in your ER diagram and determine the corresponding tables in the relational model. Each entity typically corresponds to a table in the RM.

2. <b>Create tables:</b> Create a table for each entity identified in the previous step. The table should have columns that represent the attributes of the entity, and each row in the table represents an instance of that entity.

3. <b>Define primary keys:</b> Identify the primary key for each table. The primary key uniquely identifies each row in the table and is used to enforce entity integrity.

4. <b>Establish relationships:</b> Review the relationships in the ER diagram and determine how they translate into the relational model. Relationships in the RM are represented through the use of foreign keys.

5. <b>Add foreign keys:</b> Identify the foreign keys needed to establish the relationships between tables. A foreign key is a column in one table that refers to the primary key of another table, creating a link between the two tables.
