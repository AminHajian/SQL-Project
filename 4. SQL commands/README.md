# Step four : SQL commands 

### The next step is to translate RM into SQL commands to implement them in a database system. Here is a typical order of SQL commands based on the relational algebra operations:

<br>

1. <b> CREATE TABLE:</b> Use the CREATE TABLE statement to define the tables in the database. Specify the table name and its columns along with their data types, constraints, and other properties.

2. <b>INSERT INTO:</b> Use the INSERT INTO statement to insert data into the tables. Provide the table name and the values to be inserted for each column, or specify a SELECT statement to insert data from another table.

3. <b>SELECT:</b>  Use the SELECT statement to retrieve data from one or more tables based on specified conditions. You can use various clauses like WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY to filter, aggregate, and sort the data.

4. <b>UPDATE:</b> Use the DELETE statement to remove data from a table. Specify the table name and use the WHERE clause to delete specific rows based on conditions.

5. <b>JOIN:</b> Use the JOIN keyword to combine data from multiple tables based on a common column. You can perform different types of joins such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, or FULL JOIN depending on your requirements.
